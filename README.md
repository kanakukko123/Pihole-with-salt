# Teamspeak3-server
This is my own module to setup a teamspeak server with salt to my windows 10 using saltstack master-slave. This project is a part of Tero Karvises course called palvelintenhallinta. [Tero Karvinen](https://terokarvinen.com/).

## The module
This module is made using ubuntu 20.04 LTS desktop.

First I made /srv/salt/ts file and then edited its init.sls

## Init.sls
Under work. It will create the user and the server and then make a password for it
